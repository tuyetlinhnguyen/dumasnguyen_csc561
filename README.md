CSC 561 (Spring 2023) Final Project 

Given the complications with our proposed project dataset, our new goal was to compare two different approaches for an image
recognition task: training from scratch and transfer learning. We also explored architectures, comparing performances of a CNN-based and a Vision Transformer-based model.

The final CNN model and results can be found in mnist_cnn.ipynb and the pre-trained ViT results can be found in mnist_vit.ipynb.
